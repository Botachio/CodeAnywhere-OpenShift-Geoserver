# CodeAnywhere-OpenShift
Trying to automate setting up OpenShift Tools on CodeAnywhere 

## Usage
Open CodeAnywhere Editor[1] and create a new connection:
File > New Connection > GitHub

In the dialog choose **this** repository and click NEXT.
In the next dialog choose a Ruby stack and click CREATE.

It may be possible to let CodeAnywhere choose the correct stack automatically...
